My son, give ear to my words: for I say unto you, even as I said unto Helaman, That inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God, ye shall prosper in the land; and inasmuch as ye will not keep the commandments of God, ye shall be cast off from his presence. And now my son, I trust that I shall have great joy in you, because of your steadiness and your faithfulness unto God; for as you have commenced in your youth, to look to the Lord your God, even so I hope that you will continue in keeping his commandments: for blessed is he that endureth to the end. I say unto you my",

For I knew that thou wast in bonds; yea, and I also knew that thou wast stoned for the word\u0027s sake; and thou didst bear all these things with patience, because the Lord was with thee: and now thou knowest that the Lord did deliver thee.",

Now my son, I would not that ye should think that I know these things of myself, but it is the spirit of God which is in me, which maketh these things known unto me: for if I had not been born of God, I should not have known these things. But behold, the Lord in his great mercy sent his angel to declare unto me, that I must stop the work of destruction among his people; yea, and I have seen an angel face to face; and he spake with me, and his voice was as thunder, and it shook the whole earth.",

But behold, I did cry unto him, and I did find peace to my soul. And now my son, I have told you this, that ye may learn wisdom, that ye may learn of me that there is no other way or means whereby man can be saved, only in and through Christ. Behold, he is the life and the light of the world. Behold, he is the word of truth and righteousness. And now, as ye have begun to teach the word, even so I would that ye should continue to teach; and I would that ye would be diligent and temperate in all things. See that ye are not lifted up to pride; yea, see that ye do not boast in your own wisdom, nor of your much strength; use boldness, but not overbearance; and also see that ye bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with love; see that ye refrain from idleness; do not pray as the Zoramites do, for ye have seen that they pray to be heard of men, and to be praised for their wisdom. Do not say, O God, I thank thee that we are better than our brethren; but rather say, O Lord, forgive my unworthiness, and remember my brethren in mercy; yea, acknowledge your unworthiness before God at all times. And may the Lord bless your soul, and receive you at the last",
